## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a **Computer Science graduate** and aspiring **Security Analyst / Penetration Tester** based in Nairobi, Kenya.  
With experience in **frontend development, data systems, and open-source contributions**, I’m focused on mastering secure software practices and hands-on cybersecurity techniques.

I believe in learning by doing — building, breaking, and securing systems to understand how they truly work.
