# 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I’m **Dennis Munania**, a software developer transitioning into **cybersecurity and penetration testing**.  
My background in software development, data systems, and open-source projects has shaped my approach to security — understanding how systems are built, so I can better secure and test them.

I enjoy solving complex challenges, automating tasks, and exploring vulnerabilities in a safe, ethical manner.
